The multiple choir lofts made possible complex musical effects, and during the Renaissance the choir master’s job was the most prestigious in Europe.

Its inconspicuous location at the periphery of the city signaled the subordination of the official Catholic hierarchy to the Basilica di San Marco, the site of the most important rituals. The patriarch officiated at the marriage of the sea, but he had to sail to meet the doge rather than have the doge come to his church as was usual for a marriage ceremony.",

Adapting the agrarian rituals of beating the bounds to the needs of a seafaring community, a flotilla of boats sailed to the boundaries of the lagoon. In an elaborate state ceremony, the doge aboard the gilded /bucintoro/ galley dropped a gold ring into the sea, saying “We espouse thee, O sea, as a sign of true and perpetual dominion.” The ritual opened the sailing season and declared Venice’s claims to sovereignty over the Adriatic Sea.",

Jews were free to traverse Venice’s streets, squares, and canals during the daytime hours. However, they had to return to the ghetto at sunset when they would be locked behind guarded gates. Authorities later expanded the ghetto complex. This expansion is not evident in Giovanni Merlo’s map. Merlo labels as “Il Ghetto” only the Ghetto Nuovo that housed Jews of German and Italian descent, despite the fact that officials had ghettoized Levantine and Ponentine Jews in the Ghetto Vecchio in 1541 and Ghetto Nuovissimo in 1633.",

It was compulsory housing, as German traders—according to the Senate in 1475—could not “on any pretext take lodgings in any place outside the exchange house, upon a penalty of 50 ducats.”  Following the Reformation, self-professed Protestants moved into the Fondaco. Venetian authorities permitted a German presence in the city given that the Fondaco dei Tedeschi had been well entrenched in the socioeconomic life of Venice since the Middle Ages and its newly arriving Protestants performed their so-called heretical practices clandestinely.

At the time it was built, Crete was a Venetian colony.

After he died that same year, however, the monopoly lapsed and the business passed to his brother, Wendelin. One of the two books John printed before his death was Pliny’s Historia Naturalis; the Newberry’s copy is decorated with borders, illuminated initials, and a coat of arms for a particular owner.  These embellishments helped bridge the divide between manuscripts and printed books, turning mass-produced printed volumes into one-of-a-kind objects.",

Jenson was celebrated for his typefaces: his roman type was specifically designed to aid readers of printed books by helping to “pull” or guide the eye along the page. The first book printed in this type was an edition of the Latin translation of Eusebius’ /De Evangelica Praeparatione/ (In Preparation for the Gospel); the book has exerted enormous influence on typographers over the centuries.",

12,1,0,0,"","Performed every year on Ascension Day, the marriage of the sea was originally a rite of supplication to guarantee safe sailing. Adapting the agrarian rituals of beating the bounds to the needs of a seafaring community, a flotilla of boats sailed to the boundaries of the lagoon. In an elaborate state ceremony, the doge aboard the gilded /bucintoro/ galley dropped a gold ring into the sea, saying “We espouse thee, O sea, as a sign of true and perpetual dominion.” The ritual opened the sailing season and declared Venice’s claims to sovereignty over the Adriatic Sea.","Edward Muir","","Northwestern University"
14,24,0,0,"","Built in the fourteenth century by the now defunct /Umiliati/ order, the church was originally dedicated to St. Christopher, the patron saint of gondoliers. It now takes its name from an allegedly miraculous statue of the Madonna, which the prior of the church of Santa Maria Formosa had dumped in a nearby orchard (/orto/). After reports of its miraculous powers, the /Umiliati/ rescued the statue and placed it on the high altar of their church. It contains some of the most prized works of the Venetian Renaissance, including paintings by Giovanni Bellini and especially Tintoretto, who is buried there.

Built in the sixteenth century in the Venetian Renaissance style, it conforms to Greek religious architecture by including a separate women’s gallery and an eye-catching iconostasis, a screen covered with forty-six icons by a Cretan artist. At the time it was built, Crete was a Venetian colony. The great twentieth-century composer Igor Stravinsky, a member of the Russian Orthodox Church, chose San Giorgio to be the location of his funeral mass. He is buried in the cemetery on the island of San Michele.","Edward Muir","","Northwestern University"

25,46,0,0,"","Nicolas Jenson was a French printer who learned his craft at Mainz (possibly sent by King Charles VII to conduct industrial espionage) before his arrival in Venice, where he began issuing books in 1470. While he lived in San Canciano, his workshop may have been at San Salvador in the commercial area of the /Merceria/. Jenson was celebrated for his typefaces: his roman type was specifically designed to aid readers of printed books by helping to “pull” or guide the eye along the page. The first book printed in this type was an edition of the Latin translation of Eusebius’ /De Evangelica Praeparatione/ (In Preparation for the Gospel); the book has exerted enormous influence on typographers over the centuries.","Jill Gage","","Newberry Library"

29,20,0,0,"","Legend holds that Saint Roch was healed from the plague, so following his death (1327) his body attracted devotion from those hoping to escape the plague. The Venetian Confraternity of Saint Roch (Scuola di San Rocco) was founded in 1478 and in 1485 the Scuola succeeded in acquiring the mortal remains of the Saint. The Scuola quickly became a major site for international pilgrimsand it used its fame to finance the construction of their church, consecrated in 1508, and their magnificent administrative building, whose cornerstone was laid on 25 March 1517. These two buildings sit across from one another on the Campo di San Rocco and both contained magnificent works of art by Titian, Tintoretto, and Pordenone.

8,12,0,0,"","In about 828, the Venetian Doge acquired the reputed body of St. Mark. Fires destroyed earlier churches dedicated to St. Mark on this site. Consecrated in 1093, the current basilica became one of the most spectacular churches in Christianity, largely because of its extensive mosaics. The multiple choir lofts made possible complex musical effects, and during the Renaissance the choir master’s job was the most prestigious in Europe. The private chapel of the doge for most of its history, San Marco replaced San Pietro di Castello as the official seat of the Patriarch of Venice in 1807.","Edward Muir","","Northwestern University"
11,4,0,0,"","From 1451 until 1807, San Pietro di Castello was the seat of the Patriarch of Venice. The church shown on the map dates from 1594 to 1596, partially built on a design by Andrea Palladio. Its inconspicuous location at the periphery of the city signaled the subordination of the official Catholic hierarchy to the Basilica di San Marco, the site of the most important rituals. The patriarch officiated at the marriage of the sea, but he had to sail to meet the doge rather than have the doge come to his church as was usual for a marriage ceremony.","Edward Muir","","Northwestern University"
17,23,0,0,"","On March 29, 1516, the Venetian Senate ordered all Jews residing in the city to move to the Ghetto Nuovo. Jews were free to traverse Venice’s streets, squares, and canals during the daytime hours. However, they had to return to the ghetto at sunset when they would be locked behind guarded gates. Authorities later expanded the ghetto complex. This expansion is not evident in Giovanni Merlo’s map. Merlo labels as “Il Ghetto” only the Ghetto Nuovo that housed Jews of German and Italian descent, despite the fact that officials had ghettoized Levantine and Ponentine Jews in the Ghetto Vecchio in 1541 and Ghetto Nuovissimo in 1633.","Dana E.

18,11,0,0,"","First constructed in the early thirteenth century, the Fondaco dei Tedeschi was a warehouse and living quarters for German merchants in Venice. It was compulsory housing, as German traders—according to the Senate in 1475—could not “on any pretext take lodgings in any place outside the exchange house, upon a penalty of 50 ducats.”  Following the Reformation, self-professed Protestants moved into the Fondaco. Venetian authorities permitted a German presence in the city given that the Fondaco dei Tedeschi had been well entrenched in the socioeconomic life of Venice since the Middle Ages and its newly arriving Protestants performed their so-called heretical practices clandestinely.

26,38,0,0,"","Born in Bassiano ca. 1450, Aldo Manuzio (or Aldus Manutius) was a teacher before becoming a printer committed to the publication of classical texts in the 1490s. He designed Greek and Hebrew types, as well as an italic based on a manuscript Italian hand. He also produced small format books “so that they may more conveniently be held in the hand and learned by heart” that were directed at a widening reading public. His house and workshop are thought to have been at No. 2311 Campo Sant’Agostin, close to the main marketplace for books on and near Rialto Bridge. ","Jill Gage","","Newberry Library"
24,10,0,0,"","In the late 1450s, printers began to leave Mainz for other European cities. In September 1469, John of Speyer was granted a monopoly for printing in Venice.  After he died that same year, however, the monopoly lapsed and the business passed to his brother, Wendelin. One of the two books John printed before his death was Pliny’s Historia Naturalis; the Newberry’s copy is decorated with borders, illuminated initials, and a coat of arms for a particular owner.  These embellishments helped bridge the divide between manuscripts and printed books, turning mass-produced printed volumes into one-of-a-kind objects.","Jill Gage","","Newberry Library"
30,25,0,0,"","Waning Venetian maritime power in the Eastern Mediterranean during the 16th century, accentuated by the loss of Cyprus to the Ottoman Empire in 1574, resulted in increasing numbers of Muslim merchants in Venice. Concerns about their dispersed lodgings and interactions with Christians, notably with women, led the Senate to approve housing at Rialto in 1579 for Ottomans from the Balkans. In 1621, with Muslims themselves petitioning for protection from assaults and for their activities, the /Fondaco dei Turchi/ was established by repurposing a 13th century palace on the Grand Canal. With controlled access, rooms for goods, and a courtyard on the ground floor, the structure resembled a /fonduk/, a type of residence-warehouse familiar to Venetian traders from Islamic lands. The enclosure provided oversight for the government, as well as security for residents, and seclusion for their religious observances. ","Bronwen Wilson","","University of California, Los Angeles"

The /Nicolotti/, as the inhabitants called themselves, created a proud identity that extended to all the working classes on their side of the Grand Canal.

28,50,0,0,"","The writer and Benedictine nun Arcangela (born Elena) Tarabotti (1604-1652) was an outspoken voice for women in 17th century Venice. From within the convent of Sant'Anna in Castello, Tarabotti penned several works condemning the practice of forced monachization  (the consignment of girls to convents for reasons of economic expediency rather than vocation) as well as a satire of male vanity, a collection of letters, and a rebuttal of a treatise that argued women did not have souls. Some of Tarabotti's most radical protofeminist commentary appears in her early manuscripts /Convent Hell and Paternal Tyranny/, but even the ostensibly less provocative /Convent Paradise/, Tarabotti's first published work, offers a critique of monastic life when not freely chosen.

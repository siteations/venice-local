Merlo’s map is the only one among them that is colored. Maps were rarely printed in color before the nineteenth century. Sixteenth-century Italian publishers seemed to have preferred to sell their maps uncolored, but by the late seventeenth century maps and views were commonly (though not universally) hand colored throughout Europe to enhance their attractiveness and to help clarify many of their details. Here, for example, important buildings such as the Doge’s Palace, major churches and the famous campanile in the Piazza San Marco have blue colored roofs to distinguish them from a sea of red. The green color of gardens and other open spaces helps them stand out within an otherwise densely built-up urban landscape.', 'Merlo’s view emerged from ancient form of urban representation, the bird’s-eye or perspective view, which depicts a city as if seen from a height that neither the artist nor the viewer could have achieved bodily, but could only imagine. In contrast to an orthographic plan, which imagines a city as seen from directly overhead, the perspective view allows readers to see structures and other topographic features in simulated three dimensions. One sees the facades of buildings as someone walking Venice’s streets or floating on its canals would see them <*>. Simultaneously, the heightened perspective allows the viewer grasp the city in its entirety, and so to understand its geography and layout. All is achieved through the art of perspectival representation, which lends realism to the image. But close examination and comparison with earlier views of Venice shows that the image has been manipulated to promote specific ideas about the city and highlight specific detail.']

It was printed on six large sheets, which when assembled made an image 52.3 × 109.3 in. The image recalls the Renaissance architectural fashion of fixing large plans of cities and maps of parts of the world into dedicated rooms and courtyards in palaces and public buildings, embodying the worldly and religious power and reach of their occupants.'

Islands held a particular fascination to early modern travel writing and fiction, as exotic little worlds. Thomas More’s Utopia (1516) for example, created a fictitious island to set the scene for its social and political commentary. Books describing the islands of the Aegean Sea had been popular in Italy since the early fifteenth century. In 1528 the Venetian Benedetto Bordon expanded the concept to embrace islands to the east and west newly encountered by Europeans. The concept was capacious enough to include several maps of Venice and its outlying islands, as well as the island city of Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City), which contemporaries compared to Venice. Though Bordon’s image of Venice was based on Barbari, it differs significantly from it. Structures on the main islands are greatly generalized, but Bordon offers a more expansive view of the entire lagoon. He depicts many small islands by Barbari, identifying them with their most prominent structures, usually churches.'

Forlani’s plan, first published in 1565, was sized to fit in a bound folio of maps (what we now call an atlas). Forlani’s version was widely copied by other publishers, including Donato Bertelli, whose version is the next in our sequence. Both plans adopted the practice initiated by Bordon of enclosing Venice within its barrier islands and the coast of Terraferma. The oval shape of this enclosure, however, is more concerned with closing the circle within the space of the page than with actual topography. '
